Write a set of programs that will accomplish the following -

   program0 - supervisor ::
            - will launch the programs (program1, program2, program3) on user request 
            - will keep on running and monitoring the status of the programs program1,
              program2, program3
              and if it finds that a program is not running,
                  then it will start it
            - will terminate the monitored programs on user request or upon detection of
              "job finished" condition

   program1 - dirLister :: dirs2process.lst -> new-files-found.lst
            - list a directory, whose name is found in the file dirs2process.lst,
              and appends that list to new-files-found.lst

   program2 - filesProcessor :: new-files-found.lst -> (tmp-files-info.lst, files.output)
              appends the list of directories to a file named tmp-files-info.lst
              appends the list of non-directory files to a file named files.output

   program3 - dirSelector :: new-files-found.lst -> (dirs2process.lst, dirs.output)
            - selects directories from the file new-files-found.lst based on the given
              criteria (depth and symlinks)
              and
              appends them to the file named dirs2process.lst 
              and also to a file named dirs.output

              This program must handle symlinks correctly.
